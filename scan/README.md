## Description

This folder holds the code used to create the SLHA files and run the SModelS scan
used to obtain the results for the 2MDM model. It contains the following structure:

* [configParserWrapper.py](./configParserWrapper.py): Auxiliar code for parsing through elements in [parameters file](./scan_parameters_2mdm.ini);
* [getSLHA.py](./getSLHA.py): script to obtain SLHA files with production cross-section without running MG5;
* [Cards](./Cards): Cards for generating events with MadGraph5;
* [runScanMG5.py](./runScanMG5.py): Python script used to obtain the production cross-sections via Monte Carlo simulation;
* [scan_parameters_2MDM.ini](./scan_parameters_2MDM.ini): Parameters file used as input for the MG5 scan;
* [createSLHA.py](./createSLHA.py): Python script for the creation of SLHA files using as input the .lhe files generated by MG5.


## Creating SLHA files

 To obtain the SLHA files used as SModelS input, one must first compute cross-sections and branching ratios using MadGraph5. This can done running:
```
./runScanMG5.py -p <parameters-file.ini>
```
The MadGraph output (LHE files or banner files) can be converted to SLHA files running [createSLHA.py](./createSLHA.py):
```
./createSLHA.py -f <list of .lhe.gz or banner.txt files>
```


## Running the scans

In order to obtain the SLHA files, one must simply run the [getSLHA.py](./getSLHA.py) script using as parameter the [parameters file](./scan_parameters_2mdm.ini). One example is to type the command line in terminal:
```
./getSLHA.py -p scan_parameters_2mdm.ini
```
The parameters used to create the SLHA files are set in [scan_parameters_2mdm.ini](./scan_parameters_2mdm.ini), such as the mediators and dark matter masses, the coupling parameters, as well as the output folder of the SLHA files. The cross-sections are obtained via 1D interpolation, and rescaled for the selected couplings if necessary. Cross sections for 13TeV and 8TeV are provided for both mediators, as well as the Branching Ratios for the possible 2-body decays. 

## Alternative: use compressed data

It is also possible to decompress the files in the [data](../data) directory that contain folders with .pcl files or slha files, the former were used to generate plots found in [notebooks](../notebooks/). The latter can be used as input for SModelS.
