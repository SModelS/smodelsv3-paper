## Description

* [Cards](./Cards): Cards for generating events with MadGraph5;
* [models](./models): UFO and FeynRules files for the implemented model;
* [runScanMG5.py](./runScanMG5.py): Python script used to obtain the production cross-sections via Monte Carlo simulation;
* [scan_parameters_2MDM.ini](./scan_parameters_2MDM.ini): Parameters file used as input for the MG5 scan;
* [createSLHA.py](./createSLHA.py): Python script for the creation of SLHA files using as input the .lhe files generated by MG5.

## Running the scans
 To obtain and analyze the SLHA files using SModelS, one must first generate data points using the files with '.ini' extension. To generate its own data points, run the command line on the terminal:
```
./runScanMG5.py -p <parameters-file.ini>
```
and then extracting relevant data for the SLHA file using the [createSLHA.py](./createSLHA.py) script:
```
./createSLHA.py -f <list of .lhe.gz or banner.txt files>
```
